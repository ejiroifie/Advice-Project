# Advice Project

### Requirement Gathering 

1. User should get random advice at click of a button. 
2. The content should be at center of web page.


###Planning 

1. For a project like this, just simple HTML,CSS and Javascript should be enough. 
2. We can search for good advice and quotes on the internet, copy paste and store into array and display random array element from click of a button. 
3. Second approach: find some public api on the internet which has list of random advice and allow us to use on out project.
4. we will have a Javascript Function which will be doing all the work. For example, handling a button click event and displaying resulot accordingly.
5. Ok. An API for random advice exist. Link https://api.adviceslip.com/. And it's public and free to use. 

So this is to-do list for this project: 

[] Create index.html page.
[] Create a form. 
[] Create a button. 
[] Create a basic layout. 
[] Center form on web page. 
[] Create a Javascript file. 
[] Import Javascript File into index.html. 
[]Define Javascript function which handles oneclick event.
[]Fetch data from Advice Slip API.
[]Store data into arrays as object 
[]Render that data on index.html page. Front end. 
[]Test.
